Power BI Dashboard – Education Analysis Performance
About the Project

This project is a Power BI dashboard created to analyze student performance and attendance data in an easy and visual way.
The dashboard helps in understanding overall academic performance, subject-wise scores, attendance trends, and comparisons across different groups.

This project was built to practice data analysis, DAX calculations, and dashboard design using Power BI.

Dashboard Preview

Below is a snapshot of the final dashboard:

Problem Statement

Educational data is often available in raw format, which makes it difficult to quickly understand performance and patterns.
The goal of this project is to:

Clean and organize the data

Calculate meaningful averages and percentages

Present insights in an interactive dashboard

So that performance can be analyzed easily without manual effort.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains student-level information such as:

Student ID

Gender and Ethnicity

Subject scores (English, Math, Science)

Attendance percentage

Test preparation status

Data Preparation

All data cleaning and transformation was done using Power Query, including:

Removing duplicates

Handling missing values

Correcting data types

Creating calculated fields

Tools Used

Power BI Desktop

Power Query Editor

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Dashboard Features

KPI Cards

Total student count

Average English, Math, and Science scores

Average attendance percentage

Visual Analysis

Average score percentage by ethnicity

Score comparison by gender

Attendance percentage by ethnicity

Performance comparison based on test preparation

Student-Level Insights

Attendance percentage by student ID

Top 5 students comparison across subjects

Filters

Ethnicity filter

Gender filter

Attendance percentage filter

All visuals update dynamically based on selected filters.

Calculations Used

DAX measures were created to calculate:

Average subject scores

Attendance percentages

Overall performance metrics

Filter-based calculations

These measures allow the dashboard to respond instantly to user interactions.

How the Dashboard Works
