Power BI Dashboard – Education Analysis Performance

About the Project

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze student performance and attendance data in a clear and visual manner.
It helps in understanding:

 1.Overall academic performance

 2.Subject-wise scores (English, Math, Science)

 3.Attendance trends

 4.Comparisons across different student groups

 5.The project was created to practice data analysis, DAX calculations, and dashboard design using Power BI.

### ❓ Problem Statement

Educational data is often available in raw format, which makes it difficult to quickly understand performance and patterns.
This project aims to solve that problem by:

* Cleaning and organizing the data
* Calculating meaningful averages and percentages
* Presenting insights using an interactive dashboard

This allows performance to be analyzed easily without manual effort.
